# Experiment Task EEG System

This repository hosts a comprehensive system designed for conducting EEG (Electroencephalography) experiments. It provides real-time visual feedback to participants regarding their movements and is built with integration capabilities for Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and neuronavigation software, specifically Invesalius.

The system leverages a web-based interface for experiment configuration, monitoring, and participant interaction, with a FastAPI backend handling experiment logic, hardware communication, and state management.

## Features

*   **EEG Task Feedback:** Provides real-time visual feedback (color changes, instructions) to volunteers on required movements during EEG tasks via a dedicated web interface.
*   **TMS Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with MagVenture stimulators for combined experimental protocols, allowing for precise TMS pulse triggering (arm, disarm, fire) during trials.
*   **Neuronavigation Compatibility:** Designed for initial compatibility with Invesalius software, facilitating neuronavigation alongside experimental procedures.
*   **Arduino-based Stimulus Triggering:** Utilizes an Arduino (e.g., ESP32) for precise and synchronized triggering of task stimuli. The Arduino receives a "SINGLE" command via serial to generate a 100ms TTL pulse on GPIO 23 and blink an LED on GPIO 2.
*   **Web-based User Interfaces:**
    *   **Configuration Panel (`/config`):** A comprehensive interface for setting up experiment parameters (e.g., number of trials, task duration, movement type), connecting to Arduino and TMS devices, and enabling/disabling TMS.
    *   **Experiment Monitor (`/monitor`):** Displays real-time experiment progress, including current trial, trial timer, and total time remaining, along with hardware connection statuses.
    *   **Volunteer Display (`/experiment`):** The participant-facing screen that shows dynamic visual cues (e.g., colored circles, instructions) based on the experiment's state.
*   **Experiment Management:** Currently supports the Finger Tapping experiment with various types (Unilateral, Bilateral, Bilateral Simult√¢neo), and includes capabilities to pause, resume, and cancel experiments. The system is designed to be extensible for future experiment protocols.


## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ExperimentTaskEEG.git
    cd ExperimentTaskEEG
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a Python virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    # On Windows
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Arduino Setup:**
    *   Upload the `arduino-trigger.ino` sketch to your Arduino board (e.g., ESP32).
6.  **MagVenture Stimulator:**
    *   Ensure your MagVenture stimulator is properly connected and configured according to its documentation.
    *   The system expects to communicate with it via a serial port, which will be selectable in the configuration panel.
7.  **Invesalius Software:**
    *   Install Invesalius and ensure it's configured for neuronavigation as required by your experimental setup. (Note: Direct integration details with Invesalius are not fully implemented in the provided code, but the system is designed to be compatible).

## Usage

1.  **Start the application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
2.  **Access the web interfaces:**
    *   **Configuration Panel:** Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/config` (or the port specified in your `.env`). Here you can set up experiments and connect hardware.
    *   **Experiment Monitor:** After starting an experiment from the configuration panel, you will be redirected to `http://localhost:8000/monitor` to observe its progress.
    *   **Volunteer Display:** The participant's screen should be opened at `http://localhost:8000/experiment`. This page will dynamically update with visual stimuli during the experiment.
3.  **Configure and run experiments:** Use the Configuration Panel to define experiment parameters, connect your Arduino and TMS devices, and initiate the experiment. Monitor its progress and control its state (pause/cancel) from the Experiment Monitor.
